              This application draws from public information to obtain free
              trails, camp grounds, and parks for your 4-legged pooch! Also
              provides weather data for your location! As dog owners, we wanted
              to find areas in the US where we can camp/hike with our dogs
              off-leash, so that we can spend quality time with our dogs and
              allow them to explore nature. Clicking on a state will return
              results for locations near you.

              This application will allow for the creation of a video library to
              house the class recordings for the web developer bootcamp. The
              admin (creator) will submit video links, video titles, and a few
              keywords of the key concepts that were discussed in that dayâ€™s
              recording. The non-admin user (student) will access the videos and
              will have the ability to post comments on the individual recording
              pages with questions, comments or helpful links on the subject
              matter. For an API, we are considering displaying Udemy courses or
              even just Google search results based on the keywords that are
              specific to each video.

              A software engineering team generator command line application.
              The application will prompt the user for information about the
              team manager and then information about the team members. The user
              can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of
              engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the
              team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a
              nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by
              the user.

              An application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes.
              This application uses an express backend to and save and retrieve
              note data from a JSON file. For users that need to keep track of a
              lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall
              something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows
              users to have written information available when needed.

              A command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF
              profile from a GitHub username. When preparing a report for
              stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about
              members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each
              team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will
              allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.
